I consider "I don't know" to be an antithesis to
bullshit or corprate double-speak.

## It helps foster transparency.
Certainly from my own experieinces, I've hidden behind misdirection, or
[bullshit](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/JAC/124/bs.html), when answering a question I do not know.

Why? 

Maybe I didn't want to look unprofessional in not knowing, and gave out _any_ answer.
Or on the flip-side, I wanted to have my voice heard even if I didn't have something useful to contribute.

It could be I did not understand the question, and didn't want to ask for clarification.

But at the end of the day, none of the above helps remedy the situation. It clouds the conversation,
adding unnecessary complexity to what could be an already complicated topic.

Admitting "I don't know" is the remedy.

It is clear, concise, and abrupt. It does not leave any room for misinerpresation. 

## It is efficient
You could make a game

## It can be empowering
