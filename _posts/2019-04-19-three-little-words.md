Communication is difficult. There is always opportunity for ambiguity
or misinterpreatation. But sometimes we go out of our way to make it
even more difficult. Sometimes purposefully, othertimes not. 

Lucklly, three little words can _occasionally_ fix that.

# I don't know.
One of my favorite phrases is "I don't know". It can take some humility 
for people to adming when they do not know the answer to something.

But I've almost always found it to be the best way to move a conversation forward.

## It helps foster transparency.
Certainly from my own experieinces, I've hidden behind misdirection,
[bullshit](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/rags/JAC/124/bs.html), or lack of detail
when answering a question I do not know.

Why? 

Maybe I didn't want to look unprofessional in not knowing. Or perhaps I did not understand
the question. Maybe I was feeling pressured to provide _something_, even if it wasn't quite
correct.

Saying "I don't know" helps foster transparency.

## It is efficient

## It can be empowering
