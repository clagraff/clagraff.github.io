Explain like I'm five: REST.

REST is a software architecture described by Roy Fielding's PhD dissertation on [Architectural Styles and
the Design of Network-based Software Architectures][1].

REST is defined by 6 constraints, and the various system properties that go along with them. The six constraints are:

* [Client-server separation][2]
* [Statelessness][3]
* [Cachability][4]
* [Uniform interface][5]
* [Layerability][6]
* [Code-on-demand][7] `optional`

And what do you get in return, for developing a system bound by these constraints?

* Visibility
* Reliability
* Scalability
* Performance
* Modifiability
