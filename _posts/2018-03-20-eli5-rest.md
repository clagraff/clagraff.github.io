Explain like I'm five: REST.

REST is a software architecture described by Roy Fielding's PhD dissertation on [Architectural Styles and
the Design of Network-based Software Architectures][1].

REST is defined by 6 constraints, and the various system properties that go along with them. The six constraints are:

* Client-server separation
* Statelessness
* Cachability
* Uniform interface
* Layerability
* Code-on-demand `optional`

And what do you get in return, for developing a system bound by these constraints?

* Visibility
* Reliability
* Scalability
* Performance
* Modifiability
