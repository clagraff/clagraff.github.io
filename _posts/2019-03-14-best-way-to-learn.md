title: Best way to learn

I am a believer that the best way to learn something, is to teach it. Doing so requires at least two attributes; a strong
understanding of the specific topic under discussion, and the ability to effectively communicate.

Hence, this blog.

I am hoping to use this blog for my own benefit. I would like to learn about a variety of topics surrounding
software engineering, as well as improve how I communicate my own thoughts.

A blog is a fantastic platform, and I look forward to utilizing it.
