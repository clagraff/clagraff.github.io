<p>
  I am a consultant with a decade of experience in software engineering. I have worked across multiple industries, including automotive, e-commerce, and
  embedded systems. I specialize in API development, site reliability & incident management, and agile delivery.
</p>
<p>
  I am experienced with Java, Golang, and Python backend development; Javascript & Typescript with ReactJS and Angular frontends; using AWS and Pivotal Cloud
  Foundry for infrastructure; monitoring & metrics via Splunk, Graphana, Dynatrace and more. I've worked in XP, Scrum, and Safe-style teams, and am a big
  fan of pair programming.
