  I am experienced with Java, Golang, and Python backend development; Javascript & Typescript with ReactJS and Angular frontends; using AWS and Pivotal Cloud
  Foundry for infrastructure; monitoring & metrics via Splunk, Graphana, Dynatrace and more. I've worked in XP, Scrum, and Safe-style teams, and am a big
